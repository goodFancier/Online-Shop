#### Stage 1: Build the application
FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine as build

# Set the current working directory inside the image
WORKDIR /websiteBackend

# Copy maven executable to the image
COPY mvnw .
COPY .mvn .mvn

# Copy the pom.xml file
COPY pom.xml .

# Build all the dependencies in preparation to go offline. 
# This is a separate step so the dependencies will be cached unless 
# the pom.xml file has changed.
# RUN mvnw . dependency:go-offline -B

# Copy the project source
COPY src src

ONBUILD RUN mvn install

# Package the application
ONBUILD RUN mvn package -DskipTests
RUN mkdir -p target/dependency WORKDIR target/dependency

#### Stage 2: A minimal docker image with command to run the app 
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine

#ARG DEPENDENCY=/app/target/dependency

# Copy project dependencies from the build stage
#COPY --from=build ${DEPENDENCY}/BOOT-INF/lib /app/lib
#COPY --from=build ${DEPENDENCY}/META-INF /app/META-INF
#COPY --from=build ${DEPENDENCY}/BOOT-INF/classes /app
